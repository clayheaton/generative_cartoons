<!-- This sketch generates cartoons in the spirit of those that
     appear in the New Yorker magazine. All artwork was hand drawn
     by me. Punchline grammatical structure taken from NLP analysis
     of historic New Yorker cartoons, populated with words selected
     from thematic dictionaries where theme is considered as a 
     component of the genetic algorithm. The "comic critic" on the 
     side is partially implemented. It's meant to show emotion based
     on it's feelings about comics. I didn't have time to implement it
     fully. Code is here if you want to play:
